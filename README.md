# Stellar Ray

Stellar ray is a rogulike space game that I am making in the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/).
Current features are:

* Basic player movement following the mouse.
* Shooting by pressing right mouse button.

Currently, it is just a Godot project file, there is no available export.

If you wish to play it regardless, you will require the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/) (ver. 4.2.1).
From there, you just need to import the `project.godot` file.
